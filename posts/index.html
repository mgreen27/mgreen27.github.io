                Finding the LNK: Techniques and methodology for advanced analysis

        </p>

        
        <p class="line-summary"> Malicious exploitation of LNK files, commonly known as Windows shortcuts, is a well-established technique used by threat actors for delivery and persistence. While the value of LNK forensics for cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is fairly well-understood, analysts may overlook less well-known data points and miss valuable insights. In this post, we explore the structure of LNK files using Velociraptor. We will walk through each LNK structure and discuss some analysis techniques frequently used on the Rapid7 Labs team. </p>

                How To Hunt For UEFI Malware
            </a>
        </p>

        
        <p class="line-summary"> UEFI threats have historically been limited in number and mostly implemented by nation state actors as stealthy persistence. However, the recent proliferation of Black Lotus on the dark web, Trickbot enumeration module (late 2022), and Glupteba (November 2023) indicates that this historical trend may be changing. With this context, it is becoming important for security practitioners to understand visibility and collection capabilities for UEFI threats. This post covers some of these areas and presents several recent Velociraptor artifacts that can be used in the field. </p>

        </p>

        
        <p class="line-summary"> Velociraptorâ€™s ability for data manipulation is a core platform capability that drives a lot of the great content we have available in terms of data parsing for artifacts and live analysis. After a recent engagement with less common encoded Cobalt Strike beacons, and finding sharable files on VirusTotal,  I thought it would be a good opportunity to walk through some workflow around data manipulation with VQL for analysis. In this post I will walk though some background, collection at scale, and finally talk about processing target files to extract key indicators. </p>
